# 42 Libft

A personnal creation of the 42 libft project.



## Running the library

To run this library, you first need to clone it.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sousampere/42_libft.git
```

You can then use make to create a simple versiono of the libft.a library file, that you can include when compiling a program using this library.

```bash
  make
```

Or, if you also want to include the bonus files, you can add them like this :

```bash
  make bonus
```

You can now include the libft.a library file inside your project to use the implemented functions.
